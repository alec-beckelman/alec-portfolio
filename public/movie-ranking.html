<h1>The Best Movies According to Alec</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King</h3>
<p>The culmination of the greatest series ever, It shows that friendship, working together, and faith can
    overcome evil no matter how dire the state. All whilst having awesome massive scale battles, and tear-jerking 
    ends to character arcs that leave you feeling proud of your favorite characters.
</p>
<h3>2. The Hobbit, an Unexpected Journey</h3>
<p> Similarly to my number 1 choice, though this particular film in the Hobbit Series, takes a much more
    whimsical and fun tone, which later transitions into a much more serious tone as the global events begin to
    take place. But it explores great themes such as "don't judge a book by it's cover" while tiny Bilbo Baggins
    is coming out of his shell and taking on daring and dangerous tasks.
</p>
<h3>3. Star Wars: The Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p> An incredibly sad film for a Clone fan, watching some of your favorite characters from perhaps just the movies,
    or from the animated Clone Wars series become the villans by the end. This movie shows how quickly greed, hate, and 
    anger can corrupt someone. Driving the best of friends, the closest family they had to eachother, to fight eachother to 
    the death.. or so you think.
